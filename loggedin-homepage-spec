This is the spec for the logged-in homepage. It should be the homepage that is served to the user when they are logged in.

Logged-in Homepage Spec (Implementation-Only)
Goals

Make it obvious what to do right now (“Cook something tonight”)

Reduce browsing friction (filters + smart recs + quick actions)

Make saved / recent / in-progress feel first-class

Drive repeat usage: “plan a meal → shop/cook → save notes”

Non-goals

No new backend features required

No new recommendation engine required

No major IA changes across the whole app

No complicated onboarding flows

Information Architecture & Layout
Global Layout

Two-column layout on desktop:

Main (left, ~70%): “Cook now” + recommendations + explore

Sidebar (right, ~30%): your stuff (recent, saved, lists)

Mobile: stacked sections in same order.

Section-by-Section Spec
1) Top Header Strip
Left: Greeting + context

Title (H1): “What are you cooking today?”
Subtitle: “Pick something fast, or continue where you left off.”

Right: Primary action button

Button (primary): “Create recipe”

goes to your existing create flow

Secondary action (text link): “Import recipe”

only if you already have it; otherwise omit

2) “Cook Now” Spotlight (Most important)

A large card that always appears at the top of the main column.

Title

“Cook now”

Content

Show one highlighted recipe with:

Recipe title

1-line hook (short description)

Time + difficulty + servings

2–3 tags (e.g., “20 min”, “One-pan”, “High protein”)

Actions (buttons)

Primary: “Start cooking”

Secondary: “Swap for another”

Tertiary (icon buttons): Save / Add to list

Data rules

If user has “in-progress”/last opened recipe: spotlight that.

Else show a random “good default” (existing recipes).

(No backend changes: implement as “use last viewed from local storage if available; else pick first in feed.”)

3) Continue / Recent Activity Row

Horizontal scroll row or 3-card grid.

Title

“Continue”

Cards (up to 6):

Last viewed recipes

Drafts / created recipes

Saved recipes (recently saved)

Each card includes:

Title

Small meta (time/difficulty)

“Resume” button

Empty state copy:
“Nothing yet. Save a recipe or start cooking to build your home feed.”

4) Quick Filters (Make browsing feel un-clunky)

A compact “chip bar” that changes what appears in Explore (Section 5).

Title

None (just a label above chips):
“Find something that fits…”

Chips (exact)

“≤ 20 min”

“One-pot”

“High protein”

“Vegetarian”

“Low effort”

“Meal prep”

“Comfort”

“New”

Behavior

Click chip toggles active state

Active chips filter the Explore grid client-side (no backend needed)

If no filter possible with current data, still visually apply and show fewer items

5) Explore (Recipe discovery that doesn’t feel like a blog)

This is where a grid is OK — but it must feel like tools + decisions, not content.

Title

“Explore smart recipes”

Layout

Desktop: 2–3 column grid

Cards should emphasize adaptability, not image-first.

Recipe Card Template

Each card must show:

Title

Time + difficulty

2 tags

A small “Smart” badge row:

“Swaps”

“Scale”

“Adjust time”
(icons only is fine)

Card actions

Primary: “Open”

Secondary icon: Save

“Show more” button

At bottom:
“Show more recipes”

6) Sidebar: “Your Kitchen”

Right column card stack.

6A) Saved

Title: “Saved”

Show top 5

Link: “View all”

Empty state:
“Save recipes to build your shortlist.”

6B) Your Lists (if exists)

Title: “Lists”

Examples: “Weeknight”, “Meal Prep”, “Favorites”

Link: “Manage lists”

If lists don’t exist yet, replace with:
“Make lists for your go-to meals.”
Button: “Create a list” (only if flow exists; otherwise omit)

6C) Recently Created

Title: “Your recipes”

Show last 3 created

Link: “View all”

7) Footer Micro-CTA (subtle)

Not a marketing CTA — a product nudge.

“Pro tip: Save your best tweaks.”
Small text:
“Hyper Recipes gets better when you keep your swaps and notes.”

(Only include if you already support notes; otherwise make it “Save your favorites for next time.”)

Visual Design Rules

Minimal, calm, product-y

Strong hierarchy: H1, section titles, card titles

Whitespace > borders

No loud gradients

Subtle shadows, soft rounded corners (2xl-ish)

Icons used for “smart” capabilities

Avoid “big recipe hero image” dominance

UX Rules (Critical)

The first screen should answer: what can I cook right now?

Avoid dumping user into an overwhelming catalog

Every section must have a clear action

Empty states must be helpful and short

Implementation Notes (No backend changes)

Continue row can use:

existing “recent” if available

otherwise localStorage tracked recentRecipeIds

Filters can be client-side based on existing recipe metadata:

time: parse if available; else omit those recipes when filter active

tags: if tags exist; else map from category if present

Spotlight: last viewed else first recommended

Copy (Exact)

Use these exact strings:

H1: “What are you cooking today?”

Subtitle: “Pick something fast, or continue where you left off.”

Spotlight title: “Cook now”

Explore title: “Explore smart recipes”

Continue title: “Continue”

Filter label: “Find something that fits…”

Saved title: “Saved”

Lists title: “Lists”

Your recipes title: “Your recipes”

CTA create: “Create recipe”

Spotlight primary: “Start cooking”

Spotlight secondary: “Swap for another”

Show more: “Show more recipes”
